## ðŸŒŸ Project Description

EcoTrans Assistant is designed to automate the process of answering frequently asked questions from users. The system:
- Uses a pre-prepared knowledge base (`knowledge_base.py`) to search for similar questions.
- Generates text embeddings using the `SentenceTransformer` model.
- Analyzes user queries through a graph model and the DeepSeek API.
- Returns the most relevant answer or notifies if no answer is found.

The project is ideal for companies providing car rental services, such as EcoTrans, to improve customer interaction.
